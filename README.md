# Web Design Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to build an interactive website to display weather visualizations.

Weather visualizations were created through the API challenge. In this challenge, Python was used to pull weather data via API calls. The final webpage contains a landing page with project summary and 6 linked pages detailing each comparison. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were used to create the webpage.
